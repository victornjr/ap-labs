Lab 5.1 - OpenMP Labs
=====================

This is a single lab for multiple OpenMP exercises that we'll be doing in class. The goal of each exercise is to convert its default serial implementation to
a parallel implementation with OpenMP.

The excesises for this lab include:
```
hello_par.c
pi_spmd_simple.c
pi_spmd_final.c
pi_loop.c
```

In order to compile them just use the Makefile: `make` 

After that you can just run any program by `./nameOfTheProgram`
