These are the exercises from the book "The C Programming Language". The answers are written per file 1 - 23, each one has it's own code and answer.

To run it you need to compile it first by typing:

	gcc 1-23.c -o 1-23.o

After that, just run the execution file called "1-23.out"
When executing you the terminal will be waiting for some input. So if you type something with the format of a comment of c, it will wait until you close the comment.
Otherwise, it will copy what you just wrote and print it on the terminal.
