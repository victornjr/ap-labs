These are the exercises from the book "The C Programming Language". The answers are written per file 1 - 23, each one has it's own code and answer and some of them will ask you to give some inputs, and may display some outputs.

To run them you need to compile each one independently by typing:

	cc <name of the file>.c

After that, just run the execution file called "a.out"
