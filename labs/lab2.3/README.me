Lab 2.3 - Cross-referencer
===================

This code receives a txt file when running and prints on the console all the words in order
and with a couple of numbers that show the lines in which you can find this word.
In order to compile it just do the next:
```
gcc cross-ref.c -o cross-ref
```
To run it, you need to type the name of the txt file that is going to be used.
```
./cross-ref document.txt
```
