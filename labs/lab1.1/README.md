Lab 1.1 - mycat
===============

- Rewrite the `cat.c` program by using `read`, `write`, `open` and `close` instead of their library equivalents.
- Generate a report with performance metrics between the existing `cat.c` and your `mycat.c`.
  The format of the report is free, you can add charts or whatever helps to understand the speed of both approaches.
- Update the `README.md` file with instructions about how to compile and execute your program.
