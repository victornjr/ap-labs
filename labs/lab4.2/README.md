Lab 4.2 - Matrix Multiplication
===============================
On this lab you will create a multi-threaded matrix multiplicator with the usage of the `pthreads` library. You will see the following concurrent programming concepts:

- Multitheading
- Synchronization mechanisms
- Race conditions


General instructions
--------------------

1. Use the  `multiplier.c` file for your code
2. Your program should be able to receive one argument which will be know as `NUM_BUFFERS` inside the program (e.g. `./multipler -n 8`).
3. You will read a couple of files (`matA.dat`, `matB.dat`) which contain data that will be used for the matrices multiplication. It's an array that represents all matrix's rows in an one-dimension array.
4. Below some functions that will be required:
   - `long * readMatrix(char *filename)`
     Reads matrix file and returns an long type array with content of matrix.
   - `long * getColumn(int col, long *matrix)`
     Returns the specified array that represents a column in the matrix array.
   - `long * getRow(int row, long *matrix)`
     Returns the specified array that represents a row in the matrix array.
   - `int getLock()`
     Search for an available buffer, if so it returns the available lock id which is the same buffer id, otherwise returns -1
   - `int releaseLock(int lock)`
     Releases a buffer and unlock the mutex. Returns 0 for successful unlock, otherwise -1.
   - `long dotProduct(long *vec1, long *vec2)`
     Given 2 arrays of 2000 lenght, it calculates the dot product and returns it as a long type value.
   - `long * multiply(long *matA, long *matB)`
     Here's where all the magic happens. Explained in [Matrix multiplication section](#matrix-multiplication)
   - `int saveResultMatrix(long *result)`
     Saves result matrix into a new `result.dat` file, return 0 for a successful operation, otherwise it will return -1

Some key required global variables
----------------------------------

- `NUM_BUFFERS`
  Number of temporal buffers for dot product operations
- `long **buffers`
  An array of `NUM_BUFFERS` pointers to the available buffers that will serve as temporal rows to be stored into final result matrix.
- `pthread_mutex_t *mutexes`
  Mutexes that will help to know which buffer is available
- `long * result`
  Will store the result of `matA` and `matB` multiplication


Matrix multiplication
---------------------

- You will have a loop that is creating NxN (2000*2000) concurrent threads for calculating the `row*col` operations between `matA` and `matB`.
- Each thread will execute `row*col` operation and will use available buffers for storing the result of the dot product.
`getLock` function will be required to get a buffer to have a place where to store the dot product result, if there's no available buffer, thread will need to wait.
`releaseLock` will be used to release a buffer to be used by another thread.
- At the end, you'll wait for all processes to join the main execution.
- Finally, save your result by calling the `saveResultMatrix` function.


Data files
----------
`matA.dat` and `matB.dat` are located at:
- [Classify Share](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/classify-share)


Final Requirements and Considerations
---------------------------------------
- Use the logger that was done on [lab2.4](https://github.com/CodersSquad/ap-labs/tree/master/labs/lab2.4).
- Use the `*.c` files for implementing your code.
- Use the `Makefile` for compilation.
- Update `README.md` with the proper steps for building and running your code.
- Don't forget to handle errors properly.
- Coding best practices implementation will be also considered.
