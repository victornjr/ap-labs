Lab 4.2 - Matrix Multiplication
===============================
On this a multi-threaded matrix multiplicator with the usage of the `pthreads` library was implemented. You will see the following concurrent programming concepts:

- Multitheading
- Synchronization mechanisms
- Race conditions

In order to compaile the program just use the `Makefile`

After that you need to run it in this way:
`./multiplier -n #`
Being `#` the number of buffers you want to use. (minimum 8)
