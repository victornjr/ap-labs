The exercises listed here are some basic concepts about Go. They include topics like slices, maps, functions and methods.

In order to run them you just need to do this on your console:

		go run nameOfTheFile

But for the slices and maps exercises you may need to go to the next pages and see my playgrounds, since some of the libraries that I use are not available localy.

	maps: https://play.golang.org/p/G5GaM6o0jBD

For the one of the diferences between functions and methods you just have to put the next command on your console:

		go run funcVSmethods.go
