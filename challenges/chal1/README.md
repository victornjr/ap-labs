Basically what it does is to read every single letter of the string and add it to a common array.
Everytime a letter is read, the program checks if the letter already exists in the array. If it does, then it checks the lenght of the actual substring. When the substring is bigger, then the index of the biggest substring changes, otherwise it stays the same and the actual lenght becomes 0 again.

To run the code you only need to use python 2.7 and type:

  python chal1.py

To analyze a different string, you mneed to change it directly on the last line of the code.
